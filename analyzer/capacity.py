"""Capacity sizing -- how many replicas each service needs (M/M/c math).

Given a service's measured arrival rate (lambda) and per-replica service rate
(mu), the smallest replica count ``c`` that keeps its M/M/c queue under a target
is a direct consequence of the Layer-1 model -- no redeploying, no trial and
error. Every M/M/c wait metric falls monotonically as ``c`` grows, so "the
smallest ``c`` that meets the target" is well defined and cheap to find.

Two targets, combinable:
  * utilization ceiling   rho = lambda/(c*mu) <= target_utilization  (default 0.70)
  * response-time budget  W(c) <= max_response                        (optional)

Because ``mu`` is measured PER REPLICA and is ~load-independent, sizing computed
at one load predicts the replicas needed at any load. Where ``mu`` sags under
load (contention), measuring per level (the load sweep) sizes with the ``mu``
seen at that level, so the recommendation self-corrects.
